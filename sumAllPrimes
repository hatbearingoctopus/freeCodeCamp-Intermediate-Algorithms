//Use for loop to iterate through (num) starting at 2(1st prime), to check if num is prime
//Check the inputted number by all the numbers leading up to it
//If they're equal it's prime, push to result array
//If true it isn't prime, break the loop
//Take result, reduce it for answer and return it

//reduce() - method reduces the array to a single value. It executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left to right). The return value of the function in an accumulator (result/total)
// array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initial value)
